Overview

## Primary Research Interests

Materials modeling in the context of Continuum Mechanics including higher order continua, damage and fracture as well as oxidative aging in bitumen.

Random Network Models for mimicking deformation and fracture behaviour of real materials including transport properties and dynamics.


## Teaching Portfolio
My teaching portfolio includes different levels of education in Finite Elements, Fluid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, Design of Steel and Wood Constructions, Strength of Materials, etc.
