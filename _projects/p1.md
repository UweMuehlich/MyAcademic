## Summary
Code-Aster is a powerful open-source Finite-Element program. Although the learning curve is rather steep, it is suitable for education provided that professional  guidance is provided.

 Inspired by the highly professional tutorials by <a href="https://feaforall.com/home/" class="uline" target="_blank">Cyprien Rusu </a>  in his blog called FEA for All, the intention of this project is to generate video and text tutorials to help students to master Code Aster. Of course, by doing this, I am learning a lot myself.
